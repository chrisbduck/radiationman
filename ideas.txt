Evolution
---------

Shooter game - space style?
	- Can we avoid just doing the power ups thing?
	- Waves of enemies that evolve - later waves being immune to older weapons?

Strategy game
	- Choose which units to evolve for more abilities?
	- RTS / TBS?
		- I kind of want to do something real time, but pathfinding is too much effort for the time

Platformer
	- Collect mutation objects of some sort
	- Go from defenceless -> punches -> kicks -> various weapons -> uber-destructive
	- Need a point of difference though
	- Dying of some radiation poisoning; needs to collect anti-radiation pills to stay alive?
		- End of game = cure?
	- Main character has some sort of mutation virus
	- Some power-ups are safe - "stable mutation"

Akira-style theme?
	- Main character evolves to super-destructive and destroys everything?
	- Need a game style though

FPS/TPS - too hard

God game
	- Populous-y sort of thing?
	- Actually might not be that hard to simulate lots of little people
	- Isometric view could be tricky though, particularly if I'm trying to use point sprites
		- No experience with isometric view - probably a bit risky
		- Interesting though
	- Assume the isometric view is OK for a moment.
	- What do we evolve?
		- Units:
			- Basic
				-> Worker
					-> Builder
					-> Gatherer
					-> Teacher
						-> Researcher
				-> Warrior
					-> Rock Thrower
						-> Spear Thrower
					-> Brawler
						-> Martial Artist
	- Sounds just like a bunch of clicking; probably not lots of fun

Evolution game like Spore
	- Need to think of a point of difference

Roguelike?
	- Implies unpolished; not sure really

Racing game with evolution?
	- Doesn't really seem to fit

I'm going to go with the platformer.
